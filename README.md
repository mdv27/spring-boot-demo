 - DELETE api to accept list of strings and remove all the string which is having length more than 10.
    - Return remaining.
    -  Use streams
    
### Auth microservice

stores user details in memory and provides both authorization and authentication through social media like google and facebook. There should be sign in/sign up processes and I want to see user data in afterwards via REST endpoints.


Includes:
* Spring Framework
* Testable microservice
* DB either postgres or H2
* Unit and integration tests
* Postman collection of REST calls
